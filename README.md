## Assumptions

- `info@classicrollers.org` is used as a temporary `mailto:` destination for the contact form until an official inbox is confirmed.
- `https://classicrollers.org` is used as `metadataBase` for SEO metadata and social cards.
- Scholarship and membership PDFs in `/public/forms/` are placeholder files and should be replaced with official final forms when available.
- Gallery images in `/public/gallery/` are local placeholder graphics intended for v1 launch until real club photos are provided.
